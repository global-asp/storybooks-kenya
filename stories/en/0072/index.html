	{% include picturecol.html index="02" %}	{% include textcol_start.html %}	This is the story of Ngede, the Honeyguide, and a greedy young
man named Gingile.
One day while Gingile was out hunting he heard the call of Ngede.
Gingile's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He
stopped and listened carefully, searching until he saw the bird in
the branches above his head.
"Chitik-chitik-chitik," the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next
tree, and the next.
"Chitik, chitik, chitik," he called, stopping from time to time to be
sure that Gingile followed.

	Hii ni hadithi ya Ngede, Asali-Ndege, na mvulana mmoja mlafi kwa
jina Gingile.
Siku moja Gingile alipokuwa akiwinda alisikia mwito wa Ngede.
Kinywa chake kilianza kutokwa mate kwa kufikiria juu ya asali.
Alisimama, akasikiliza na kuangalia vizuri hadi alipomwona yule
ndege akiwa ametuwa kwenye matawi yaliyokuwa juu ya kichwa
chake.
“Chitik-chitik-chitik,” yule ndege mdogo alitatarika aliporuka na
kutua kwenye mti uliokuwa karibu, tena na mwingine.
“Chitik-chitik-chitik,” aliita, huku akinyamaza na kuhakikisha
kwamba Gingile alikuwa amemfuata.

huge wild fig tree.
Ngede hopped about madly among
the branches. He then settled on
one branch and cocked his head at
Gingile as if to say, "Here it is!
Come now! What is taking you so
long?"
Gingile couldn't see any bees from
under the tree, but he trusted
Ngede.

	Baada ya nusu saa, walifikia mti wa
mtini. Ngede aliruka kama mwenda
wazimu kutoka tawi moja hadi
nyingine. Kisha alitulia kwenye tawi
moja na kupindua kichwa chake
kumwangalia Gingile kama kusema,
“Iko hapa! Njoo sasa! Kwa nini
wachukuwa muda mrefu?”
Gingile hakuweza kuona nyuki
wowote kutoka chini ya mti, lakini
alimwamini Ngede.

	{% include picturecol.html index="04" %}	{% include textcol_start.html %}	So Gingile put down his hunting
spear under the tree, gathered
some dry twigs and made a small
fire.
When the fire was burning well, he
put a long dry stick into the heart of
the fire. This wood was especially
known to make lots of smoke while
it burned.
He began climbing, holding the cool
end of the smoking stick in his
teeth.

	Kwa hivyo Gingile aliweka chini ya
mti mkuki wake alioutumia
kuwinda, akakusanya vijiti
vilivyokauka na kuwasha moto
mdogo.
Moto ulipokuwa ukiwaka vizuri,
aliweka kijiti kirefu katika mwake.
Mti huu ulijulikana kwa kutoa moshi
mwingi ulipochomeka.
Alianza kukwea mti huku akishika
kwa meno yake sehemu isiyokuwa
ikichomeka.

buzzing of the busy bees. They
were coming in and out of a hollow
in the tree trunk – their hive.
When Gingile reached the hive he
pushed the smoking end of the stick
into the hollow.
The bees came rushing out, angry
and mean. They flew away because
they didn't like the smoke – but not
before they had given Gingile some
painful stings!

	Muda mfupi baadaye, aliweza
kusikia sauti ya nyuki
wakijibiddisha. Walikuwa waiingia
na kutoka kwenye upenyo wa mti,
yaani mzinga wao.
Gingile alipoufikia mzinga,
alisukuma ile kuni ya moto ndani ya
ule upenyo.
Nyuki waliharakisha kutoka ndani
wakiwa na hasira na uchungu.
Waliruka na kwenda mbali kwa
sababu hawakupenda moshi – lakini
walifanya hivyo tu baada ya
kumuuma Gingile kwa uchungu!

Ngede called out angrily, "VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!"
Gingile stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. "You
want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work,
and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey
with you?" Then he walked off.
Ngede was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get

	Lakini Gingile aliuzima moto, akachukuwa mkuki wake na kuanza
safari kwenda nyumbani bila kumjali ndege yle.
Ngede aliitana kwa hasira, “USH-ndi! USH-ndi!”
Gingile alisimama, akamkodolea macho yule ndege kisha
akacheka kwa sauti. “Unataka asali chache, rafiki yangu? Ha!
Lakini ni mimi nilifanya kazi yote pamoja na kuumwa na nyuki.
Kwa nini nigawane nawe hii asali tamu?” Baada ya kusema hivyo,
aliondoka na kwenda zake.
Ngede alikasirika sana! Hivi sivyo ndivyo alistahill kutendewa!

to rest in a great umbrella thorn. "Ahh," thought Gingile.
"The hive must be in this tree." He quickly made his small fire and

alisimama na kupumzika chini ya mti wa mwavuli.
“Ahh,” Gingile aliwaza. “Lazima mzinga umo ndani ya mti huu.”
Kwa harak aliwasha moto wake na kuanza kukwea mti huku
akibeba kuni iliyotoa moshi kwenye meno yake.
Ngede alikaa na kuangalia tu
